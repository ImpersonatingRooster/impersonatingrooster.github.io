                <p id="firstPar">In 2017 I finally took the leap and dove into the Hobby of FPV drones. At the time, it was a 
                    relatively small hobby, and next to no one in the province was into it. So, I had no choice but to
                    teach myself how to build and fly these drones using the online resources I could find online. I have
                    always been attracted to things that had a steep learning curve, as the process of learning and hopefully
                    eventually mastering said thing is one of the most satisfying things to me.

                <p id="secondPar">By the time I returned from my Backpacking trip in 2019, I had spent a large amount of time 
                    behind the goggles and had gotten pretty good at flying FPV drones. Throughout these two years, I was consistently
                    posting on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stunny.fpv/">drone instagram page</a>. It was mostly acrobatic flying, but I would occasionally upload a cinematic FPV clip here 
                    and there, which had a really cool unique look compared to your regular drone shots. This got the attention of a small video 
                    production company, <a href="https://picnicstudios.ca">Picnic Studios</a>. I worked there not only as a drone pilot,
                    but as a camera operator, I handled sound recording, lighting, editing, and various other things from start to finish
                    to complete a video project for a client. I was at Picnic for about 4 years, until I went to Dalhousie University
                    for my Bachelor of Computer Science.
